# Previous: 1) Data is more comprehensive 2) Based on experience

# Question 1: Examining the difference in prevalence of mental illness across types of company/ years / regions / gender / age / 

# [3] "Is your employer primarily a tech company/organization?"  
# Years
# [60] "What country do you work in?"  & [61] "What US state or territory do you work in?"   
# [57] "What is your gender?" 
# [56] "What is your age?"  


# 2) Examine societyâ€™s attitude towards mental illness. 

# [26] "Have your previous employers provided mental health benefits?"     
# [28] "Did your previous employers ever formally discuss mental health (as part of a wellness campaign or other official communication)?" 
# [30] "Was your anonymity protected if you chose to take advantage of mental health or substance abuse treatment resources with previous employers?" 
# [31] "Do you think that discussing a mental health disorder with previous employers would have negative consequences?"  
# [35] "Did you feel that your previous employers took mental health as seriously as physical health?"  
# [36] "Did  you hear of or observe negative consequences for co-workers with mental health issues in your previous workplaces?"
# [39] "Would you bring up a mental health issue with a potential employer in an interview?"    
# [41] "Do you feel that being identified as a person with a mental health issue would hurt your career?" 
# [42] "Do you think that team members/co-workers would view you more negatively if they knew you suffered from a mental health issue?" 
# [43] "How willing would you be to share with friends and family that you have a mental illness?"    
# [44] "Have you observed or experienced an unsupportive or badly handled response to a mental health issue in your current or previous workplace?"   
# [54] "If you have a mental health issue, do you feel that it interferes with your work when being treated effectively?"                                                                
# [55] "If you have a mental health issue, do you feel that it interferes with your work when NOT being treated effectively?"  
# [63] "Do you work remotely?"  


# 3) Building classification model to predict mental illness status.

# [46] "Do you have a family history of mental illness?"  
# [47] "Have you had a mental health disorder in the past?"   
# [51] "Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?" 

# 4) Complications between mental illness. 

# [51] "Have you been diagnosed with a mental health condition by a medical professional?" 
# [52] "If so, what condition(s) were you diagnosed with?"
